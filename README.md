# EezyPeezyGame
 MaltaGameProject

In this project my part is to be mainly programmer and implement music and sound effects. From github:s repository you can find scripts that i have made -> assets/scripts/turonscripts.
I have also worked at user-registeration and user login systems for this game(not completely ready so those functions are not in this build). With firebase authentication and database.
i have also worked with addressable assets - local and cloudbased use.
in scenes: all minigame scenes exept labyrinth, simonsays and mapnavication are mine. Also spaceTransit scene is made by me. plus little this and that to other scenes.
This project mainly teached me how important good and functional team is in game project.
